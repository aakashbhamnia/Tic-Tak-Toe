# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows users to add tasks to a to-do list, mark them as complete, and delete them.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the add button.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the check button next to each task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks by clicking the trash button next to each task.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks based on their status (All, Completed, or Incomplete).
- **Local Storage**: The game uses local storage to persist tasks across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the interface, including layout, colors, and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic of the to-do list, including adding, deleting, marking tasks as complete, and filtering them.
